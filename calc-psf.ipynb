    "#### File size\n",
    "Note that compression is available as part of an HDF5 \"dataset\". I am not sure how \"datasets\" relate to how I am saving things here, but it is something I could consider for the future. I only use the .mat files when generating the initial PSFs; my own deconvolution code uses a different (and smaller-footprint) storage method. So, in principle we could then delete the original .mat files to save space. All that matrix compression would do is to make those original .mat files smaller, so it's not really a high priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loading with Matlab\n",
    "Some of the .mat files I generate seem to be readable by Matlab itself, but others (large ones?) aren't. I get an error saying \"Not a binary MAT-file\". I don't know what the issue is there. I am not planning on investigating this further any time soon, since I'm not that fussed about my files being readable by Matlab. If it was a real issue, I could presumably find some other way of accessing the information and reading it into Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that I also tried using scipy.io to save, but it turns out that very large matrices cannot be saved in the old in Matlab version 5 format that this supports."
