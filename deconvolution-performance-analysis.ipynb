I think the most important point is that there is clearly a minimum run time, and both 1 and 8 threads cases *can* achieve that; either *might* take longer than that, but the 8 thread case is more likely to. I imagine this must be due either to cache residency or memory bandwidth contention. I would guess cache residency isn't such a big deal, simply because I think the work sizes are already larger than the caches.\n",

For the most part, the bandwidth is unavoidable, though I did achieve a ~10% speedup by chunking together two convolves (the ones with and without x-mirroring) to reduce the read bandwidth slightly. I reckon anything further along those lines would be complicating the code quite a bit, without much prospect of getting a significant improvement.\n",

    "More time is being lost waiting for a mutex for 1z,2t compared to 2z,1t. This might just be because there is less FH work to be getting on with, and so there are more threads ready to do work.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, with 1z,1t, while threads are inevitably sitting idle I am actually making pretty good use of time - the accumulator mutex is held by somebody almost all the time. However, we are being less efficient with the 2z,t1 and 1z,2t cases. There, we often only hold one of the mutexes at a time. It might be possible to adjust the scheduling code to be more effective with the mutexes (which I think in practice means getting a bit ahead of ourselves with FH rather than waiting until we run out of work entirely). An alternative strategy would be to create additional temporary accumulators and combine them at the end, to support more parallelism. Some perspective though: I do care about the 1z,2t case, but I could only speed it up by 33% (respectable but not earth-shattering); the 4z,2t case is probably more representative of Nils' data, and that has no idle time."
