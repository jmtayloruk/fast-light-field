    "Status: my new code (which eliminates some of the FFTs) takes 16 seconds instead of 63. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without exploiting symmetries it takes 23 seconds. I had to write C code to speed up the generation of the reflected/transposed FFT matrices - without that it was barely any faster than just computing the rfftn for all aa,bb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, 2/3rds of the time is spent in fft2, so that is the bottleneck. If I insist on a square array then I could halve that, but that would be a limitation. I could, I suppose, make it a *recommendation* that allows the code to run faster. I could certainly take advantage of that for my own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
