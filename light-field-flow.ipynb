    "Status: my new code (which eliminates some of the FFTs) takes 16 seconds instead of 63, on my laptop - for a 2x2 tiled-up input [I did this to give more reproducible timings with a larger work size].\n",
    "\n",
    "Without exploiting symmetries it takes 23 seconds. I had to write C code to speed up the generation of the reflected/transposed FFT matrices - without that it was barely any faster than just computing the rfftn for all aa,bb.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, 2/3rds of the time is spent in fft2, so that is the bottleneck. If I insist on a square array then I could halve that, but that would be a limitation. I could, I suppose, make it a *recommendation* that allows the code to run faster. I could certainly take advantage of that for my own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the original dataset size, on my mac pro, my code takes 6.5s (single-threaded) to back-project plane 4, compared to Matlab's 2.2s (multithreaded). \n",
    "\n",
    "On my mac pro, full backprojection takes 96s single-threaded or 13s parallel(!), of which 1s is on the merging at the end (which I should be able to speed up too). Matlab with multithreading took 28s, so I have achieved a >2x speedup. More would have been nice, but it's still fairly respectable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: my c code can't cope with an array that has been transposed (Probably because it assumes adjacent strides in x?). I should probably fix that, though I doubt it's a performance issue to just .copy() the transposed array, which is what I do at the moment. I should really be swapping the transpose to be the final operation (in the case of square inputs) anyway. However, it looks as if a decent chunk of the fft time is actually being spent in the other ffts (for the reduced arrays) anyway!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance investigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Actual thread execution time seems to grow considerably with the number of threads, i.e. efficiency falls. I am not sure how to try and work out what the cause of that is. I could go back to working on dummy data (no transfers between processes) and see if that makes a difference to *that* in particular. (I think I may have looked only at the dead time overheads - which are also an issue).\n",
    "I looked at user and system cpu time, and with Instruments. Looks like 20% of time is spent in madvise (macbook, 2 threads). I am not sure exactly why or where that is happening. It seems to be related to python memory management in some way. I should check if that grows with number of threads on mac pro, and if it is the same when I use dummy work blocks rather than passing to subprocesses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance improvements to make\n",
    "\n",
    "Move transpose to final operation (since it's probably faster than reversing an array - although it may impact subsequent fft performance?), in the case of square arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "fft2 returns a double array (on macbook, at least) for float input. I would much prefer it to return complex64. I could well believe it might be a performance hit to do it this way (larger memory footprint). Can I improve on this? I suppose I could call through to c code that calls fftw, for example\n",
    "\n",
    "Code now supports a third dimension for the camera images (and object z plane), so that we can implement PIV. At the moment it just iterates - performance should be improved by only calculating FT(H) once.\n"
